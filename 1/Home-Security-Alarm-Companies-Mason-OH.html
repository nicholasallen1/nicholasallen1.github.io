<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home abilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Search for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and economical cloud storage for recorded video.
