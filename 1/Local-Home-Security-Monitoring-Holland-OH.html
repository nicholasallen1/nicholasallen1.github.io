The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall.
