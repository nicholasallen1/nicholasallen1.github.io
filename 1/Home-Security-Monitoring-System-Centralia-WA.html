<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the much better deal for you. If you understand you'll stay put for a minimum of 3 years, choose the agreement and gain those cost savings.

Is it a false alarm? Has the entry sensor merely been tripped by a family pet or animal? Or do you have something to stress over? Without being able to see a visual confirmation, you will either have to rush back home only to find a false alarm or you'll have to contact your next-door neighbors, friends, or household to sign in.</p>

Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is normally a simple process, and it is typically possible to bring all of your existing sensors and devices to the new wireless system.
