<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was developed for homeowners. It must be installed by an expert alarm installation group and, once installed, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big properties and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your house.
