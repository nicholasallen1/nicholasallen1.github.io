These include heat, motion, sound and facial detection for precise signals, a broader viewing angle, and microphones for two way conversation.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer.
