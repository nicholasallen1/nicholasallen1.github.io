<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
