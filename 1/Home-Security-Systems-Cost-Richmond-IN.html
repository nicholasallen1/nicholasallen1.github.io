CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
