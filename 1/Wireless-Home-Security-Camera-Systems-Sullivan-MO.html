<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for short battery life by far.

It delivers full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and disarm your system, turn lights and other electronics on and off, and control the thermostat so you never ever need to come home to a cold house. ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can control your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful residents with mobile phones is much better security than one security individual seeing 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>
