<p>We required guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to start the heater at 5am. The first guard got here early so he could look at the whole location and talk to me about my concerns. He was professional, extremely reassuring and courteous. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the event started, he was also professional, polite and reassuring. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will suggest that we contact your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't worry as soon as after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands.</p>
