Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
