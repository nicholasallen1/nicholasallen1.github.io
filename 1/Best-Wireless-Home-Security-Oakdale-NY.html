<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating systems. You can automatically make the wise lights turn on to frighten away possible intruders if the motion sensors are set off.</p>
