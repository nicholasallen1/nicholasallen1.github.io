<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the fact, which indicates that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage space. A lot, in truth, that they need about four times the hard disk space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
