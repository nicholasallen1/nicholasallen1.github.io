<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
