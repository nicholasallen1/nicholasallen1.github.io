<p>Lots of wireless home security systems are can be installed by the property owner and have a basic setup procedure. But security systems that require a phone line connection are generally advanced and require professional installation by a specialist. That said, we truly liked Brinks' uncomplicated package options. You'll have 3 options to choose from, which range from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
