<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
