Now, many security systems include a variety of parts, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, among other components. However I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved money on a remote server run by the maker, rather of at your house) is the standard nowadays, however some cameras save recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard disk drive.
