<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary worth. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
