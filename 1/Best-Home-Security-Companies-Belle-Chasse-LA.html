The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
