Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."

Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too.
