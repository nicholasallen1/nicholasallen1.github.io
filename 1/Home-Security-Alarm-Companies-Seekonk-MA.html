<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
