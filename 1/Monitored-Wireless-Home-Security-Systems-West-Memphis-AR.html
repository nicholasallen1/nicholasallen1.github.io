When your alarm system is activated or shut down, you can also setup notifies to be sent. That spotlight puts it into direct competitors with something like the Ring Spotlight Webcam Battery, though there's no battery here - you need to wire this up to a power socket inside (or outside) your home in some way. The connection is wireless, so the Swann Floodlight Security Camera should have no problem hooking up to your Wi-Fi and pinging your phone each time it identifies something suspicious.</p>

<p>Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control board does require to be set up by a professional and connected  to a source of power.
