What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in perfect conditions like brilliant sunlight?

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and costly method to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
