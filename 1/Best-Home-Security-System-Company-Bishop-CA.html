You can even pair multiple cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However considering that many retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyway (a worker slipping some additional money while offering a client change, for example), we believe it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>Advantages: low rate of incorrect alarms, very reputable sensors, and high rate of detection. My Alarm Center's packages are powered by premium equipment.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative wise home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is pricey, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
