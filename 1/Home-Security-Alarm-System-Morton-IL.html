It works as the brains of the system, connecting with sensing units and 3rd party-devices by means of Z-Wave and controlling them utilizing the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo excels is customer support.

<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300.
