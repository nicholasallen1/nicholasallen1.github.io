<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.

<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
