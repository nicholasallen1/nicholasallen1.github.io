<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have observed some enhancements because the camera's launch, and will continue to update this evaluation and evaluate, as required.</p>
