<p>The real factor cameras are usually released is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have not lowered criminal activity. "As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the basic downward trend in offences and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications however there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had reduced criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
