However suicide assaulters are plainly not discouraged by camera - and might even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the minimal advantages that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
