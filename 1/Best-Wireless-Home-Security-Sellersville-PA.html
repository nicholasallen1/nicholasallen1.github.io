We also found it simple to establish, scalable to big and small homes, and configurable with a variety of devices, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature level sensors. SimpliSafe likewise works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to examine the system and arm using only voice commands.
