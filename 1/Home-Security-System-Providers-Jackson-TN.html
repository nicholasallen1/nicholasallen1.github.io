You will not have to drill holes to run cable televisions, but you may need to up the camera closer to a power outlet.

Just like their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone. They are fairly simple to install, however if you're comfy or not familiar with electrical wiring, you might wish to have an expert electrical expert get the job done.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would notify users when it detected any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the present system.</p>
