<p>While it strikes the resolution, we believe there's a little interpolation on its 4K footage considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TELEVISION utilizing Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime prevention designed to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in location of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
