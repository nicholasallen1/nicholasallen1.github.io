<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup understood to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work).

<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, however the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video.

<h3>The Best Home Security System in Texas</h3>
