Often, local municipalities need home security alarm permits These licenses are stated to help in reducing the number of false alarms so that emergency situation services aren't needlessly taxed.

That's a high cost for home automation when compared to competitors like Vivint, which lets you include those functions at every tier (starting at $40 monthly).

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
