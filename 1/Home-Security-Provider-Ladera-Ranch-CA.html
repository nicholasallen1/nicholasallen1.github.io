<p>Home security systems and modern clever home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone.

<h3>House Alarm Systems Companies Ladera Ranch CA 92694</h3>
<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are difficult to scale up due to the fact that once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to acquire a totally new DVR before including another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
