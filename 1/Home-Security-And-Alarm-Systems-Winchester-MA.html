<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
