<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
