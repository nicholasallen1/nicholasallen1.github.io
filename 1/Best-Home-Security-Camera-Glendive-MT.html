<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
