Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by.
