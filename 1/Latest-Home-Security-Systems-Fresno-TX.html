The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp image as much as 32 feet.
