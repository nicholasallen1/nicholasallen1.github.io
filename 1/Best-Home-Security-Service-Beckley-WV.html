<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
