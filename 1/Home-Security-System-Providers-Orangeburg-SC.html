<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items.

The other major decision when selecting a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will often be developed to be more able and long lasting to endure rain, frost, or damp.

<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, permitting audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more know-how to setup, and usually cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units communicate with a control panel.
