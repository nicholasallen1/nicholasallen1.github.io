<p>Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's typically skewed by factors such as hesitation over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While enhancements in recent years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>

DVRs generally use what is called D1 resolution, which is the conventional video quality utilized in closed-circuit tv systems. D1 equates to a resolution of 720 x 480, which is considered basic resolution.</p>
