<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make clients stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

<h2>The History Of Home Security Independence</h2>
