Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
