Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring.

Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models.
