It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for additional cloud storage.

If you're trying to find night vision cameras that provide the brightest and best night view, choose models that utilize infrared (IR) technology.

With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
