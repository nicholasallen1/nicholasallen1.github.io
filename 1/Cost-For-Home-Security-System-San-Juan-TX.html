Here's a take a look at the basic elements of a typical CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We started with 16 cameras & have actually grown to 25 cameras. When we needed to include new cameras or troubleshoot concerns, Tim in Tech Support has been very useful. He is very patient with those of us that don't have competence in the IP world.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs wail, felines shriek, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

Both also lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize incorrect informs.</p>
