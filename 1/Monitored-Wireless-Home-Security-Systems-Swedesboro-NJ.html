<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
