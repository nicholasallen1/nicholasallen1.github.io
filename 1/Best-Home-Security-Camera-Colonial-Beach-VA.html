<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would alert users when it discovered any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to robbery decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
