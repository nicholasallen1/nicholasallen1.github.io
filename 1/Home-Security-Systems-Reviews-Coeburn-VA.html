<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be watched at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be careful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers.
