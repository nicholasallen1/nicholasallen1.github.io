<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
