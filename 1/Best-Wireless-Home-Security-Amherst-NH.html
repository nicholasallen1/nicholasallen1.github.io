<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity avoidance designed to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will minimize crime and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with in advance fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
