<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers.</p>
