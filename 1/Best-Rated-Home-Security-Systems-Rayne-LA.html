Home automation and control expenses around $36.99 and video services can be found in at $52.99. Installation and other costs might apply. Contractually, this is a 3-year contract with a six-month trial. The good news is this means ADT accepts cancellations without charge for the first six months - but just if the company fails to resolve any installation or service-related issues. If you're unable to show this, early cancellation charges use.</p>
