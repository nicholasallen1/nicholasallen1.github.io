<p>You might think you'll never ever be targeted, but why take the chance? An estimated 2,000,000 thefts take place in the United States every year. Theft prevention is a required precaution to ensure the safety of your personal belongings. An alarm system can serve a number of functions to this end. In many cases, its existence can function as a deterrent-- robbers are less apt to target a spot where it is most likely that they will encounter such interference. In other situations, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert people in the area (in addition to the authorities) that something is wrong. This guarantees a rapid reaction and reduces the burglar's opportunities of success.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your overall security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.
