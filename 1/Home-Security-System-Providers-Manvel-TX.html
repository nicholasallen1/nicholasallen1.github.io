<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
