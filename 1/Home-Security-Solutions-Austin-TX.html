<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the fact, which indicates that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area. A lot, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage.

It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it does not have wires that can be cut.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
