<h3>Top Home Security Systems in Indiana</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Rates - ADT provides 3 separate packages, which differ in terms of alternatives offered. The basic home security plan is $28.99 each month. Home automation and control costs around $36.99 and video services come in at $52.99. Installation and other costs might apply. Contractually, this is a 3-year agreement with a six-month trial. The bright side is this means ADT accepts cancellations without penalty for the very first 6 months - however just if the company stops working to solve any installation or service-related concerns. If you're not able to show this, early cancellation costs apply.</p>
