<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
