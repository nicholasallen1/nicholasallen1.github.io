<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
