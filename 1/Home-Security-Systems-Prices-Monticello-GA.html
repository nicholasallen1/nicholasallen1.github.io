You could invest a comparable amount for the best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard.

<p>Flood lights are frequently utilized in combination with motion detectors. When sensing units detect motion, the lights light up the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will possibly frighten trespassers. Much better outdoor lighting also suggests a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When picking flood lights, consider the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
