<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident.
