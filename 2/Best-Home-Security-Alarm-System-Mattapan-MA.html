CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adapt and record outstanding low light video, commercial cameras surpass their cheaper cousins.</p>
