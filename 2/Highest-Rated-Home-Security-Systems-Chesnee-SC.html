No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
