<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets growl, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
<p>The Residence Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong choice for some people.

Both the original Residence system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we tested that likewise deals with HomeKit. We have actually come across a couple of technical problems while long-lasting screening the Home Iota, and so will continue to evaluate and update appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
