<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
