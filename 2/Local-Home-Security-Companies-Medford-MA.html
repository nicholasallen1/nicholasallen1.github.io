The sensing unit can also start a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will also create an email alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you know if someone is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensor.

Wide-angle lenses decrease the variety of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or much better.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most economical monitoring strategy starting at $10. You can get all the essentials like push, e-mail, and sms signals, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most affordable, Always On" plan. However, you will have to spend for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this does not come with professional monitoring. This extra cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>

<p>The primary difference is the method the signal is sent Analogue systems turn the signal into a format a Video recorder or tv screen can get.
