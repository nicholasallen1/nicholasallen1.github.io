<p>The main distinctions in between the 2 systems are wires and prices. Due to the fact that it's in the title of the two systems, the wires are obvious. The wired system depends on wires to install the system. It will be linked completely to the house and will be inseparable from the hardwiring of your home.

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
