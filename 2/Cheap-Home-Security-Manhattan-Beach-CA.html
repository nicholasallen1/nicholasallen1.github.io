<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal abuse. In 1997, for example, a top-ranking police official in Washington, DC was captured using cops databases to collect information on customers of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of parking lot at the club and researching the backgrounds of the vehicles' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were wed. Envision what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
