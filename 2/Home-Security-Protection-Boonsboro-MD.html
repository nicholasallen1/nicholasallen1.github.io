<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
