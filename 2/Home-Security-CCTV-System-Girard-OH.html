<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
