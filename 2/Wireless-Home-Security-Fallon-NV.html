<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Tenants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can quickly be set up at various properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security plans also permit remote control of the system and general home automation.
