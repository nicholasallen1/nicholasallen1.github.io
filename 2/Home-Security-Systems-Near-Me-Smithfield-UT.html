<p>To assess reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you might also require a nearby outlet. A lot of cameras need an Air Conditioning connection, which means you won't be able to place them simply anywhere.
