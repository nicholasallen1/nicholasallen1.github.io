In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. If you've already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the group will have the ability to reuse the existing circuitry.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane.
