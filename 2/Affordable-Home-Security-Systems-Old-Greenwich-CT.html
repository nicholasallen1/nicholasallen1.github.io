But the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is spotted. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.
