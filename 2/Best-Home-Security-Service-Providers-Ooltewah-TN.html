<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary mobile phone app that permits people who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider might notice someone behaving suspiciously. Lots of people are messing, surfing or texting with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a photo of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a couple of clicks. Reports from cellphone users can be rapidly reviewed and acted on by Public Safety officials.</p>

This likewise depends upon the provider, however you can expect signing an agreement with companies who require professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could span as much as 60 months or 5 years. If you wish to avoid having to sign an agreement, we would suggest thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system rather.</p>
