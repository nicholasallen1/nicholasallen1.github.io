Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or subscribe to a security part as a part of a "clever home" bundle; these technologies rely on user passwords to arm and disarm them. To keep these devices secure, it's advised that consumers routinely alter their passwords and never share them with individuals outside the household.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
