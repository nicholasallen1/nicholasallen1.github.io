<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
