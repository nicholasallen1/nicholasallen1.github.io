<p>We love that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, however the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a huge deal considering the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- but for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
