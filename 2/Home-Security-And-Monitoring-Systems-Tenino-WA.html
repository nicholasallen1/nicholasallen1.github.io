<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensors, cameras, and various detectors all connected to a main control board through radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage area for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

The second surprise was the presence of home security system hacking.

As a result we made certain to consider the risks of false alarms and hacking too when surveying home security companies.</p>

Alarms activated by legal but unintentional entry to the property, i.e. kids returning home, visitors, next-door neighbors taking care of the home while you are on vacation and shipment males do not fulfill the standard for waiver.</p>
