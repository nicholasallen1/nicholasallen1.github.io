<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can quickly be established at various homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too.
