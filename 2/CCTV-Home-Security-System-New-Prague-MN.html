A couple of designs use batteries, making placement more versatile, however this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition area. Wi-Fi coverage also affects where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smartphone or laptop gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>

Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might reveal a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or better. After reading the comments on this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they used; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter package I think starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so altogether a good deal.</p>
