A few models use batteries, making positioning more versatile, but this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competitors area. Wi-Fi protection likewise impacts where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smartphone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

Wired systems need professional installation, and you can't quickly include equipment or move it around. You're tethered by wires. Wireless systems use a freedom that wired systems can not.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Monitors can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
