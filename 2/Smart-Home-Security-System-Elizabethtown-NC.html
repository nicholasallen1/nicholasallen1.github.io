<p>One of the very best aspects of this alarm is that it has a very sophisticated motion sensing unit.

If your motion sensor is set off, you get an alert in your smart device app. There's no latency so you get alerted immediately so you can take instant actions such as setting off a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the possible trespassers.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation.
