(The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But since the majority of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some extra money while offering a customer change, for instance), we think it's more important to have premium images so you have the evidence you require. And that's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential transgressors are less likely to devote crime if they think they are being seen or have a greater risk of being apprehended. This is likewise known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the transgressor should know the included surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>
