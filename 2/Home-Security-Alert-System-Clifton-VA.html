In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
