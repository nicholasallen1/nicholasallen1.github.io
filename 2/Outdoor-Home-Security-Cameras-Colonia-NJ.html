We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.
