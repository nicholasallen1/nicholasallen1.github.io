<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and different detectors all linked to a primary control panel through radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>
