The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers cast doubt on the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
