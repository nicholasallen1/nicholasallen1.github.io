<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
