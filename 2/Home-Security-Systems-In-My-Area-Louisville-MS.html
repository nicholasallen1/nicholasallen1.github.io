When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
