<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Renters, unlike house owners, typically avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can easily be set up at different homes in the future, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.
