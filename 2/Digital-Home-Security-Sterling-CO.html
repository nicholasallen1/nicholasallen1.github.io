Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and for how long you plan to keep taped footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
