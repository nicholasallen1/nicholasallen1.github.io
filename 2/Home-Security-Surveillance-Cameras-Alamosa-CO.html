<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for big properties and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your house. The team will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you've already installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
