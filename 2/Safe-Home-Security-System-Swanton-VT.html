Somebody has to be actively watching the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to discover criminal activity prior to it happens.

<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention developed to avoid both individual and property crime and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review.

<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. If a patient is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or generally closed.
