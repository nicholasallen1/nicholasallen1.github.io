<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small fee. Because it comes with numerous door and window sensing units for complete protection, we recommend the eight-piece kit. We also advise including a doorbell video camera eventually. The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the in advance cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring costs and all equipment.

The Arlo Pro is the company's first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in features and resolutions by newer designs, the original still holds up well.
