If the wireless security system is not on an agreement basis, all of these expenses will be paid upfront.

DVRs normally use what is called D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems. D1 corresponds to a resolution of 720 x 480, which is considered basic resolution.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Monitors can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
