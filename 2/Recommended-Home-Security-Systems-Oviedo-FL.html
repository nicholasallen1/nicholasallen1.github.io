The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
