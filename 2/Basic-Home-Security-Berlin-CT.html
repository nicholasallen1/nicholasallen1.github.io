<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other choices, however that added security produces a harder installation procedure, and it costs nearly two times the rate of the Nest Webcam Outdoor.</p>
