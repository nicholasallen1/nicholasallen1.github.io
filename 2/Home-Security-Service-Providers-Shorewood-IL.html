<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must carry a share of the cost.

However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to police capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers fund cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and expensive technique to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
