<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to properly spot motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, however it may leave you with recording gaps during crucial security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd advise one of our top picks, however the Arlo is great for checking in on family and family pets-- or roaming cats sliding around your yard.</p>

Numerous of the cameras we tested offered the option to utilize battery power, but we have yet to find the perfect one.
