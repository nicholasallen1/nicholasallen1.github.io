<h3>Home Security Alarm System in Arizona</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days.
