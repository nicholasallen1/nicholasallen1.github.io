Audio and video verification strategies use microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, usually a Web protocol (IP) network, to the main station where displays retrieve the images through exclusive software.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
