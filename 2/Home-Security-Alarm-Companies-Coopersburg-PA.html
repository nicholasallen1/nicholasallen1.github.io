<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life by far.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve information after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a lot of recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
