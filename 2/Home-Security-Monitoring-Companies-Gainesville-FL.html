What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular scenarios such as nanny cameras or checking in on a pet, though when seeking to collect proof of a crime they frequently lose.</p>
<p>Easy alarm installation. One of the most discouraging parts of a home security system is the alarm installation.

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles regularly pass.)

Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>
