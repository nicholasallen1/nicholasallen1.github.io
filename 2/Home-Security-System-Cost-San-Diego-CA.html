<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
