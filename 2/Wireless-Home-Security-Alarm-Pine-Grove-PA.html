IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful aggressor, because the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of information and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the malicious attacker to record these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
