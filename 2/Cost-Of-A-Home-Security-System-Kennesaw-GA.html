Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a terrific alternative for a variety of various configurations.</p>
<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send signals, make sure it deals with other wise gadgets. Numerous recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras provide assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), a web service that uses small programs (applets) that you produce to have the camera interact with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light indoors or activate an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
