<p>Another crucial subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
