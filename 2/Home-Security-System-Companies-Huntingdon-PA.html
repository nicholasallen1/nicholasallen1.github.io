<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we frequently try their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of testing, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint.
