<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey approach to theft decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
