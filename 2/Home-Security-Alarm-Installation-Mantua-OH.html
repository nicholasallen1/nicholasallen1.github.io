As just recently as ten years earlier, consumers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems changed that. Initially, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company. The consumer paid month-to-month charges.</p>
<p>As formerly pointed out, the affordable video surveillance options, like any electronic device, have durability in milder climates and climate-controlled environments.
