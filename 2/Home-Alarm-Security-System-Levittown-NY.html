<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
